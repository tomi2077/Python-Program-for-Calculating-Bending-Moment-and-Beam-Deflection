# Python-Program-for-Calculating-Bending-Moment-and-Beam-Deflection
3 Weeks Worth of Python Learning Output and I managed to put-together a beam bending moment and deflection calculation program.

I have a goal to write a program everyweek. My long term (year long,starting early August) target is to be proficient in Python and probably other languages as well. A lot of new programmers say "I have learnt programming, but I don't know what to do with it", I think there is a lot to do with it. I am a Structural Engineer(Civil Engineering industry), and I have seen an enormous challenges in our industry programming automation can help solve and mitigate. I look forward to meeting collaborators on Github to help adavnce my skill and also to make valuable contributions as well.
